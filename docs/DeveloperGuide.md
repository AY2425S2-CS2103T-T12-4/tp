### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking execution of delete command API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute a command (e.g. `delete 1`), it passes the input to the `AddressBookParser`.

2. The `AddressBookParser` identifies the command and, if necessary, creates a specific parser (e.g. `DeleteCommandParser`) to parse the input.

3. This results in a `Command` object (e.g. a `DeleteCommand`) which is returned and then executed by `LogicManager`.

4. The command interacts with the `Model` during execution — for example, it may call `setPendingDeletion(person)` to store the target person while waiting for user confirmation.

5. The result of this execution is wrapped in a `CommandResult` object, which is returned from `Logic`.

---

6. When the user types `y` to confirm, the input is passed again to `LogicManager`, which treats it as a **new command**.

7. The `AddressBookParser` parses this as a confirmation and directly returns a `ConfirmCommand`.
   > 📌 *Note:* `AddressBookParser` does **not** create a specific parser for confirm commands, as they are simple and handled directly.

8. `LogicManager` executes the `ConfirmCommand`, which:
    - Retrieves the person marked for deletion via `getPendingDeletion()`
    - Performs the deletion using `deletePerson(person)`

9. A new `CommandResult` is returned, indicating that the deletion was successful.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add New Patient

The `add` feature allows users to register a new **elderly patient** into SilverCare’s address book, ensuring essential information such as name, phone number, address, gender, appointment date, medicines, and medical notes are captured.  
This feature supports home-visit nurses and healthcare workers in efficiently managing patient records.

#### Overview

* **Command format:**  
  `add -n NAME -p PHONE -a ADDRESS -g GENDER [-d APPOINTMENT_DATE] [-c CONDITION]... [-det DETAIL]... [-med MEDICINE]`

* **Required fields:**  
  `-n` (Name), `-p` (Phone), `-a` (Address), `-g` (Gender)

* **Optional fields:**  
  `-d` (Appointment Date), `-c` (Condition Tags), `-det` (Detail Tags), `-med` (Medicine)

* **Behavior:**
    * Adds a new patient entry into SilverCare’s records if the command is valid.
    * Adding beyond the maximum patient limit (30 patients) is disallowed.
    * Duplicate checking is performed based on custom logic.


<div class="alert alert-primary">
  <strong>📋 Duplicate Checking Logic:</strong><br><br>
  SilverCare uses a <strong>custom duplicate definition</strong> suited for elderly care contexts:<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Two patients are treated as <strong>duplicates only if both</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Their <strong>names</strong> are identical, and</li>
        <li>Their <strong>phone numbers</strong> are identical.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Otherwise, they are treated as <strong>different individuals</strong>, even if:
      <ul>
        <li>They share the same phone number but have different names (e.g., shared phones).</li>
        <li>They share the same name but have different phone numbers.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  This design acknowledges that in settings like old age homes or multi-residence households, different patients may share contact numbers or addresses.
</div>


#### Key Classes & Logic

![AddCommandClassDiagram](images/AddCommandClassDiagram.png)

* `AddressBookParser`
    * Recognizes the `add` command.
    * Passes arguments to `AddCommandParser`.

* `AddCommandParser`
    * Tokenizes and parses input arguments based on defined prefixes.
    * Validates presence of mandatory fields.
    * Parses fields via `ParserUtil`, applying constraints (e.g., name length, phone format).
    * Constructs a `Person` object.
    * Returns an `AddCommand` initialized with the new `Person`.

* `AddCommand`
    * Executes the addition of the new `Person` into the model's address book.
    * Enforces duplicate checking and the patient limit constraint.

* `UniquePersonList`
    * Adds the `Person` if no duplicate is found and capacity permits.
    * Automatically sorts the list by upcoming appointment dates.

* `Person`
    * Represents an elderly patient record, holding immutable fields such as name, phone, address, gender, appointment date, medicines, conditions, and details.


#### Design Considerations

* **Name Length Restriction:**
    * Names must be between **1 to 50 characters**.
    * This ensures proper UI display without breaking layout across different window sizes.

* **Phone Number Validation:**
    * Must consist of only **numeric digits (0-9)**.
    * Must be between **3 to 15 digits**.
    * No `+`, `-`, spaces, or special characters are permitted.

  *Rationale:*
    * Ensures simplicity in validation and consistency in stored data.
    * Avoids ambiguity across international formats if country codes are added separately in the future.

* **Fault Tolerance:**
    * If mandatory fields are missing, field formats are invalid (e.g., wrong phone number, invalid date), or constraints are violated (e.g., exceeding name length), the `add` command fails safely.
    * Clear error messages guide the user to correct the input without crashing the system.

* **Extensibility:**
    * Adding more optional fields (e.g., emergency contacts) can be done by extending `Person`, `AddCommandParser`, and `AddCommand` accordingly.

* **Consistency:**
    * All new patients are validated, parsed, and added through a consistent, centralized flow, ensuring system-wide data integrity.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
  <strong>💡 Patient-Focused Data Entry:</strong><br><br>
  SilverCare is designed to manage <strong>elderly patients</strong>, not caregivers or next-of-kin.<br><br>
  If the contact number provided belongs to a caregiver or family member instead of the patient, it is recommended to clearly mention this information using the <code>-det</code> (detail tag) field.<br><br>
  This helps users maintain clarity when viewing patient records, but it is <strong>not strictly enforced</strong> by the system.
</div>



### Delete Patient or Clear List

The `delete` and `clear` commands allow users to remove individual patients or clear the entire address book.  
Both operations require confirmation (`y` to proceed, `n` to abort) before the action is finalized.  
This two-step process helps prevent accidental data loss.

#### Overview

* **Delete command format:** `delete INDEX` – Initiates a request to delete the patient at the specified index from the displayed list.
* **Clear command format:** `clear` – Initiates a request to clear all patient records from the address book.
* **Confirmation format:** `y` – Confirms and proceeds with the pending delete or clear operation.
* **Abort format:** `n` – Cancels the pending delete or clear operation.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>⚠️ Important Behavior Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The deletion or clearing does <strong>not</strong> happen immediately upon <code>delete</code> or <code>clear</code>.</li>
    <li>The system enters a <strong>pending</strong> state, waiting for explicit user confirmation.</li>
    <li>If the user types a recognized new command (other than <code>y</code> or <code>n</code>), the pending operation is <strong>abandoned</strong> automatically.</li>
    <li>If the user types an unrecognized input while a pending operation exists, the system <strong>prompts the user again</strong> for a clear yes (<code>y</code>) or no (<code>n</code>).</li>
  </ul>
</div>


#### Key Classes & Logic

![DeleteClearClassDiagram](images/DeleteClearClassDiagram.png)

1. `DeleteCommand`
    * Parses the provided index.
    * Validates that the index is within bounds and refers to an existing patient.
    * Sets the `pendingDeletion` field in `ModelManager`.
    * Returns a `CommandResult` prompting the user to confirm or abort.

2. `ClearCommand`
    * Checks if there are any patients to clear.
    * Sets the `pendingClear` flag in `ModelManager`.
    * Returns a `CommandResult` prompting the user to confirm or abort.

3. `ConfirmCommand`
    * If a pending deletion exists, deletes the targeted `Person`.
    * If a pending clear exists, clears the entire address book.
    * If both deletion and clear are pending simultaneously (should not normally happen), throws a `CommandException`.

4. `AbortCommand`
    * If a pending deletion exists, cancels the pending delete operation.
    * If a pending clear exists, cancels the pending clear operation.
    * If both are pending simultaneously, throws a `CommandException`.

5. `ModelManager`
    * `pendingDeletion`: holds the `Person` object marked for deletion (or `null` if none).
    * `pendingClear`: boolean flag indicating if a clear operation is pending.
    * Provides methods to set, check, and clear these pending states.

6. `LogicManager`
    * `checkPendingConfirmation(String commandText)` method checks for pending confirmations.
    * If user input is unrelated to confirmation:
        * If input is a **recognized command**, pending operations are **cleared automatically**.
        * If input is **unrecognized**, the system **throws a `ParseException`** prompting the user to confirm properly.

---

#### Design Considerations

* **Fault Tolerance:**  
  Deleting or clearing does not happen immediately, ensuring users cannot accidentally delete important data with a single misclick.

* **User Flexibility:**  
  If users change their mind midway and type another valid command, the app cancels the pending operation and executes the new command normally.

* **Consistent Confirmation Flow:**  
  Whether deleting one patient or clearing the whole address book, users confirm with a simple `y` (yes) or `n` (no).

* **Extensibility:**  
  Future operations that require user confirmation can reuse the same pending confirmation mechanism (e.g., batch deletions, bulk updates).


### **Find patients by name**

The `find` command allows users to search and filter patients by their name. This is particularly useful for home-visit nurses who need to locate patient records quickly during appointments.

#### **Overview**

* **Find command format:** `find -n KEYWORDS` 
* `KEYWORDS` can be a full name or a partial name. 
* Multiple keywords can be provided and are space-separated.


* **Example usage:** `find -n John` / `find -n Alice Bob`


#### **Behavior**

* Matches patients whose names contain **all** of the specified keywords.
* Matching is **case-insensitive** and allows for **partial matches**.
* If no patients match the keywords, an appropriate message is displayed to the user.


<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>⚠️ Important Behavior Note:</strong><br><br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>All provided keywords must be found in the same patient's name</strong> for a match to occur.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Example: If the user searches <code>find -n Alice Bob</code>:
      <ul>
        <li>"Alice Tan" matches "Alice" but not "Bob".</li>
        <li>"Bob Lee" matches "Bob" but not "Alice".</li>
        <li><strong>Result:</strong> No patient will be displayed because neither patient matches both keywords simultaneously.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>


#### Highlighting Matches

* After search results are displayed, the **matching portions** of the names are **highlighted**.
* Highlighting is case-insensitive and works even for partial matches.
    * Example: Searching for `find -n ann` will highlight "Ann" in "Annabelle" and "Johann".

This improves usability by helping users quickly spot the relevant matches in the results list.


#### **Key Classes & Logic**

![FindByNameClassDiagram](images/FindByNameClassDiagram.png)

1. `FindCommand`
    * Accepts a `Predicate<Person>` when constructed.
    * During execution, calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
    * Returns a `CommandResult` indicating the number of patients found, or a message if none were found.

2. `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`
    * Implements `Predicate<Person>`.
    * Takes a list of keywords.
    * Returns `true` if the `Person`'s name contains any of the keywords, ignoring case.

3. `ModelManager`
    * Handles updating the filtered person list via `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
    * The updated list is then shown in the UI automatically.

4. `PersonCard`
    * Handles **highlighting** of matching name parts in the UI after a successful search.

#### **Design Considerations**

* **Case-Insensitive Search:**  
  Improves usability by ignoring capitalization differences between user input and stored names.

* **Partial Matching:**  
  Allows flexible searches — e.g., entering "Ann" matches "Annabelle" and "Johann".  
  This enables nurses to find patients even if they cannot remember the full name or exact spelling, improving efficiency during home visits.

* **Independent Patient Matching:**  
  Keywords are checked independently against each patient’s name. There is no cross-patient aggregation of keywords.  
  This ensures that search results accurately reflect a single patient's record matching all criteria, avoiding confusion where unrelated patients might otherwise satisfy different parts of the search unintentionally.

* **Fault Tolerance:**  
  No crashes occur if there are no matching results. An informative message is displayed.

* **Extensibility:**  
  The `Predicate<Person>` architecture makes it easy to extend to other fields (e.g., conditions, addresses) without changing the core logic of `FindCommand`.

#### Example

| User Input | Behavior                                                                                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `find -n John` | Displays all patients whose names contain the word "John" (case-insensitive).                         |
| `find -n joHN` | Displays the same results as `find -n John` — the search is case-insensitive.                         |
| `find -n` | Error — name keyword cannot be empty.                                                                 |
| `find -n John Doe` | Displays all patients whose names contain both "John" and "Doe" in that order. |
| `find -n Annette John` | Displays patients whose names contain both "Annette" and "John".                                      |


### Find Patients by Appointment Date

This `find` feature allows users to search for patients who have a specific appointment date scheduled.  
This functionality is helpful when nurses want to quickly check who they are scheduled to visit on a particular day.

#### Overview

* **Command format:** `find -d APPOINTMENT_DATE`
* Filters patients whose appointment date exactly matches the provided date input.
* Supports both date-only format (e.g., `yyyy-MM-dd`) and full datetime format (e.g., `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`).

#### Behavior

* Users must provide a valid date format. Otherwise, parsing fails and an error is shown.
* Matching is **exact** — the appointment must match the date input provided.
    - If the input includes only the date (e.g., `2025-04-10`), only appointments on that date (ignoring time) are matched.
    - If the input includes date and time (e.g., `2025-04-10 14:30`), the match is stricter, including both date and time.
* Partial matches (e.g., just matching the year or month) are not supported.


#### Key Classes & Logic

![FindByAppointmentDateClassDiagram](images/FindByAppointmentDateClassDiagram.png)

1. `FindCommandParser`
    * Detects the `-d` prefix in user input.
    * Parses the appointment date string provided.
    * Creates a `FindCommand` with an `AppointmentDatePredicate`.
    * Throws a `ParseException` if the date format is invalid.

2. `AppointmentDateContainsKeywordsPredicate`
    * Implements `Predicate<Person>`.
    * Checks if a patient's appointment date matches the parsed input date.
    * Supports parsing both:
        * **Date-only** (`yyyy-MM-dd`) — matches any appointment with that date.
        * **Datetime** (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`) — matches the exact appointment datetime.

3. `FindCommand`
    * Accepts the `AppointmentDatePredicate` during construction.
    * During execution, calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`, updating the view to show only matching patients.

4. `AppointmentDate`
    * Represents a patient's appointment date field.
    * Ensures that date strings stored in the system are valid and consistent.

5. `PersonCard`
    * Handles **highlighting** of matching appointment dates in the UI after a successful search.


#### Design Considerations

* **Strict Date Parsing:**  
  The command enforces strict formatting to prevent confusion caused by ambiguous or partial dates.

* **Two-level Matching Flexibility:**
    - If users input only the date (no time), matches are based on the date alone.
    - If users input full date and time, matches are based on both.

  This balances ease of use (for day-based searches) with precision (for exact-time searches).

* **Fault Tolerance:**  
  When invalid date formats are entered, the system throws a `ParseException` with a clear message, guiding users to correct their input without crashing the app.

* **Extensibility:**  
  The `Predicate<Person>` structure means the logic for date matching is fully encapsulated. Future enhancements (e.g., range searches, week-based searches) can be added by introducing new predicates without modifying core classes like `FindCommand`.

* **Highlighting Matches:**  
  Matching appointment dates are **highlighted** in the UI after search results are shown.  
  This improves visibility and quickly draws attention to relevant fields.


#### Example

| User Input | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `find -d 2025-04-10` | Displays all patients with appointments on 10 April 2025, regardless of time. |
| `find -d 2025-04-10 14:30` | Displays only patients with an appointment exactly on 10 April 2025 at 2:30 PM. |
| `find -d 2025-4-10` | Error — invalid format. Requires leading zeros (e.g., `2025-04-10`). |


### Find Upcoming Appointments

The `upcoming` feature under the `find` command allows users to filter and display only those persons who have future appointments scheduled. This functionality is useful for quickly identifying clients with pending appointments.

#### Overview

* Command format: `find upcoming`
* Filters out persons whose appointment dates are **before or equal** to the current date and time.
* Supports both date-only and full datetime formats (e.g., `2025-04-01` or `2025-04-01 14:30`).

#### Key Classes & Logic

![UpcomingAppointmentClassDiagram](images/UpcomingAppointmentClassDiagram.png)

1. `FindCommandParser`
    * Detects if the user input is exactly `"upcoming"` (case-insensitive).
    * If matched, it returns a `FindCommand` initialized with an `UpcomingAppointmentPredicate`.
    * This diverges from the usual `-n` (name) or `-d` (appointment date) prefixes.
2. `UpcomingAppointmentPredicate`
    * Implements `Predicate<Person>`.
    * Extracts the `appointmentDate` from each `Person`.
    * Attempts to parse the string as either:
      * a full datetime using format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`, or
      * a date-only format `yyyy-MM-dd` (defaults to `00:00` for comparison).
    * Compares the parsed result to `LocalDateTime.now()` and returns `true` only if the appointment is strictly after the current moment.
3. `AppointmentDate`
   * Normalizes and validates user-inputted date strings.
   * Accepts and validates both formats using regex and Java's `DateTimeFormatter`.
   * Helps maintain consistent formatting throughout the system.
4. `FindCommand`
   * When executed, it passes the predicate to the model's `updateFilteredPersonList()`, causing the filtered list to update with only persons matching the predicate.


<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>⚠️ Important Limitation:</strong><br><br>
  Each <code>find</code> command is designed to accept only <strong>one search type at a time</strong>.<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>You must choose either:
      <ul>
        <li>Find by <code>-n</code> (Name),</li>
        <li>Find by <code>-d</code> (Appointment Date), or</li>
        <li>Find <code>upcoming</code> appointments.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Combining multiple types in one command (e.g., <code>find -n John -d 2025-12-12</code>) is <strong>not supported</strong> and will result in an error displayed to users.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


#### Design Considerations

* **Fault Tolerance:**  
  Parsing errors during predicate evaluation (such as invalid appointment dates) result in a safe `false` return.  
  This ensures the app remains stable and does not crash even if invalid data is encountered during a search.

* **Extensibility:**  
  The predicate-based design allows easy addition of new search filters (e.g., finding past appointments, filtering by appointment week) without modifying existing logic.  
  Developers can simply introduce new `Predicate<Person>` classes to extend functionality.

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
  Each class involved in the find-upcoming feature has a clear and separate responsibility:
    - `FindCommandParser` handles parsing the user’s input.
    - `UpcomingAppointmentPredicate` handles checking appointment timing logic.
    - `AppointmentDate` handles formatting and validation of date strings.  
      This separation improves maintainability and readability of the codebase.


### Edit patient details

The `edit` feature allows users to modify the details of an existing patient in SilverCare’s address book.

#### Overview

* **Edit command format:** `edit INDEX [-n NAME] [-p PHONE] [-a ADDRESS] [-g GENDER] [-d APPOINTMENT_DATE] [-c CONDITION]... [-det DETAIL]... [-med MEDICINE]`

* **Required fields:** `INDEX` (the index of the patient to edit, from the displayed list)

* **Optional fields:** Any combination of `-n`, `-p`, `-a`, `-g`, `-d`, `-c`, `-det`, `-med`

* **Example usage:**
  ```
  edit 1 -n John Doe -p 91234567 -a 123 Clementi Ave 3 -g Male
  edit 2 -d 2025-05-01
  edit 3 -c High BP -c Diabetes -det wheelchair-bound -med Panadol
  ```

#### Behavior

* The `edit` command allows **selective field updates** — only the fields provided are modified.
* Fields not specified remain unchanged.
* Editing patient information that would cause duplication (e.g., creating two patients with identical name and phone number) is disallowed.
* After editing, the patient list is **re-sorted automatically by upcoming appointment dates**, if the appointment date was changed.

> 📌 **Important:**  
> If a patient's appointment date is edited, the patient list dynamically reorders itself to maintain chronological sorting of upcoming appointments.  
> This ensures that nurses always view patients in order of scheduled visits.

* If no fields are provided to edit, the system shows an error:  
  `At least one field to edit must be provided.`

* If the provided index is invalid (e.g., out of bounds), an appropriate error message is shown.

---

#### Key Classes & Logic

![EditCommandClassDiagram](images/EditCommandClassDiagram.png)

1. `EditCommand`
    * Receives the index and an `EditPersonDescriptor` containing the new field values.
    * Retrieves the corresponding `Person` from the current filtered list.
    * Creates a new `Person` by combining the existing fields and the edited ones.
    * Validates against duplication rules.
    * Updates the model with the edited person.
    * Refreshes the filtered list with `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`.
    * **If appointment date was modified:**  
      The person list is automatically re-sorted by upcoming appointment dates.

2. `EditCommand.editPersonDescriptor`
    * A helper class that stores which fields are edited.
    * Supports checking whether any field was actually modified.
    * Makes defensive copies of tag sets (`conditionTags`, `detailTags`).

3. `ModelManager`
    * `setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)` updates the address book entry.
    * `updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` refreshes the patient list.
    * The person list is **automatically sorted by appointment date** after any addition or edit that modifies appointment dates.

4. `UniquePersonList`
    * Handles person uniqueness checks when replacing a person.
    * Ensures that two persons with the same identifying information cannot coexist.

5. `PersonCard`
    * Displays updated patient information in the GUI.
    * **Highlights** search keyword matches for names and appointment dates if a find operation is active.

---

#### Design Considerations

* **Minimal disruption:**  
  Only the specified fields are updated; all other information remains unchanged, reducing the risk of unintentional data loss.

* **Fault tolerance:**
    - Prevents edits that would result in duplicate patients.
    - Provides clear error messages when index is invalid or no fields are specified.
    - Ensures system remains stable and data remains consistent even if partial input is provided.

* **Automatic sorting:**  
  Whenever appointment dates are edited, the patient list is **re-sorted automatically** without requiring manual intervention.  
  This guarantees that the nurse's view remains organized by upcoming visits.

* **Consistency with add flow:**  
  Editing fields uses the same validation rules as adding a patient (e.g., name format, phone number restrictions), ensuring consistent data quality.

* **Extensibility:**  
  Future fields (e.g., adding emergency contacts, allergies) can be incorporated easily into the edit mechanism by expanding `EditPersonDescriptor` and adjusting parsing logic.


### List Patients

The `list` feature allows users to reset the patient view to display **all currently stored patients**.  
This is particularly useful after performing a search, filter, or any operation that narrows down the patient list.

#### Overview

* **Command format:** `list`

* **Behavior:**
    * Displays all patients currently stored in SilverCare.
    * If the list was previously filtered (e.g., after a `find` command), the view resets to show the full list.
    * The patients are shown **sorted by appointment date** (earliest first), as per the address book's standard ordering.
    * No parameters are needed — simply typing `list` is sufficient.

#### Key Classes & Logic

<img src="images/ListCommandClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

1. `ListCommand`
    * Implements the `Command` interface.
    * When executed, it calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)`.
    * This resets the filtered list to include all persons from the address book.
    * Returns a `CommandResult` with a simple success message ("Listed all persons").

2. `ModelManager`
    * Holds the `updateFilteredPersonList()` method.
    * When `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` is passed in, it resets the internal filtered list to include **all persons**.

3. `PersonCard`
    * The UI automatically updates to display all persons.
    * Patients are shown with their respective details (name, phone, address, appointment date, conditions, etc.).
    * Patients remain **sorted by appointment date** after listing — because the internal list is always maintained sorted whenever patients are added or edited.

#### Design Considerations

* **Simplicity:**  
  No arguments are required — a simple `list` command brings back the full patient list immediately.

* **Fault Tolerance:**  
  No errors occur if `list` is used when already viewing all patients — the operation is harmless and simply reaffirms the full list.

* **Consistency:**  
  Patients are consistently displayed **sorted by upcoming appointment date** to help nurses easily prioritize visits.

* **Extensibility:**  
  Future versions could extend the `list` command with optional flags (e.g., `list archived`) to display archived patients separately without affecting the current structure.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Nurses who do home visits for elderly patients
* Needs to manage a significant number of contacts
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI-based apps

**Value proposition**: The app will help nurses caring for elderly patients manage contact details of their home-visit patients within one platform.

<blockquote style="color: #333333;">
Note: At present, SilverCare is designed to manage patient contacts only. It does not support storing information for family members, guardians, or emergency contacts. This decision was made intentionally to keep the app focused and avoid ambiguity during patient record management.

## **Appendix: Effort**
The development of **SilverCare** involved adapting and extending the AddressBook-Level3 codebase to better suit the needs of home-visit nurses.
The team focused on improving usability, expanding patient-related functionality, and ensuring the application remained robust and maintainable.

**Key development efforts included:**

* Enhancing core commands (`add`, `edit`, `find`, etc.) to support patient-specific data such as appointment dates, conditions, and medication

* Refactoring the model and storage structure to accommodate new fields and tag types

* Updating and writing unit tests to ensure system correctness after changes

* Streamlining the user interface and user guide to better support a non-technical audience

The team maintained regular weekly check-ins to coordinate tasks, discuss challenges, and review progress.
All members contributed equally across design, implementation, and testing phases, ensuring a balanced and collaborative workflow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5
### 1. Disallow adding past appointment dates
**Current Limitation:** The system currently allows users to add appointment dates that have already passed.

**Planned Enhancement:** Restrict users from entering past dates for new or edited appointments.

**Sample Output:**
`Appointment date must be today or later.`

### 2. Make the medicine field more structured and repeatable
**Current Limitation:**
The medicine field is currently a single long string, which accepts comma-separated medicine names but offers no structure or repeatability.
Users cannot add medicine entries separately or include details like dosage and frequency.

**Planned Enhancement:**
Allow the `-med` field to be repeatable and support structured input for each entry (e.g. name, dosage, frequency).
This makes it easier to store, update, and display individual medication records.

**Sample Input (future):**
`-med Paracetamol (500mg, twice a day) -med Omeprazole (20mg, once daily)`

### 3. Improve input validation and matching for name-based search
**Current Limitation:**
The `find -n` command accepts any non-empty input and defaults to “no patients found.” and has a strict matching format. 

**Planned Enhancement:**
* Detect clearly invalid inputs (e.g. empty, all-symbol, extremely short) and display a more meaningful error message.
* Allow less strict matching such as correct/partial name match in wrong order and partial matches in correct order.

**Sample Output:** 
* `Search term is invalid. Please enter a proper name.` 
* `find -n Doe John`, `find -n Do Jo`, `find -n Jo Do` and `find -n John Doe` all returning patient John Doe.

### 4. Allow appointment date to be cleared using the edit command
**Current Limitation:**
Unlike `-c` and `-det`, providing an empty `-d` does not clear an existing appointment date.

**Planned Enhancement:**
Support clearing the appointment date by accepting `-d` with no argument during edit.

**Sample Input:** `edit 1 -d  `

### 5. Add find-and-replace functionality for editing tags
**Current Limitation:**
Editing a single condition or detail tag requires re-entering all tags, as the current logic replaces the entire existing list.

**Planned Enhancement:**
Introduce a `find-and-replace` syntax to update a specific tag in-place.

**Sample Input:**
`edit 2 -c Migraine->Chronic Migraine -det Lives Alone->Requires Assistance`

### 6. Warn users about overlapping appointments
**Current Limitation:**
There is no indication if multiple appointments are scheduled for the same date and time.

**Planned Enhancement:**
Detect and warn the user when a newly entered appointment overlaps with an existing one for the same patient.

**Sample Output:**
`Warning: This appointment overlaps with another on 2025-07-20 at 14:00.`

### 7. Fix highlight issue in multi-word name searches
**Current Limitation:**
When using `find -n` with multi-word input (e.g. John Lim), matches are returned but highlighted text only works for single words.

**Planned Enhancement:**
Improve result rendering to highlight all matched words in multi-keyword searches.

### 8. Enable multi-name search to match across multiple patients
**Current Limitation:**
`find -n Bob Amy` only returns matches where both keywords are found in the same patient name. It does not return separate matches for “Bob” and “Amy.”

**Planned Enhancement:**
Allow find -n to return results for any of the keywords (logical OR), not just matches containing all of them.

### 9. Improve robustness of flag handling 
**Current Limitation:**
`edit 1 -med panadol -cough syrup` causes medicine field to be edited to `panadol` while conditions field to `ough syrup` due to the `-c` flag present.

**Planned Enhancement:**
Better flag handling to ensure the intended field is updated as expected when the input contains other flags.
