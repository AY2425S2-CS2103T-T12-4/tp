**Welcome to SilverCare!**

SilverCare is a **simple desktop app** that helps you keep track of your patients during home visits.
It‚Äôs built to be **fast** and **easy** to use, so you can spend less time on admin and more time with your patients.

Most actions, like adding a new patient or looking someone up, are done by typing **short commands**.
It might seem unfamiliar initially, but it becomes second nature with some practice.

There are also a few helpful buttons for things like getting help, changing the colour theme, or closing the app, just what you need, without the clutter.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes on Command Format:**<br>

Before jumping into the features, here are a few simple tips on how commands work in SilverCare:

* Words in **CAPITAL LETTERS** are parameters that you need to fill in.
    
    **e.g.** `add -n NAME` means you should type something like `add -n John Doe`.
* Square brackets [ ] mean something is optional.

    **e.g.** `-n NAME [-c CONDITION]` can be used as `-n John Doe -c High BP` or just `-n John Doe`.
* Three dots (‚Ä¶‚Äã) mean you can include that part as many times as you need.

    **e.g.** `[-c CONDITION]‚Ä¶‚Äã` allows you to type nothing e.g. `-c` or `-c High BP -c Diabetic -c Asthma`
* Command parts can be entered in any order.

    So `-n John -p 91234567` and `-p 91234567 -n John` both function the same.
* Extra input won‚Äôt break commands like `list`, `help`, `exit`, or `clear`.

    **e.g.** `help 123` is treated the same as `help`. 

> **Tip for PDF users:** If you‚Äôre copying commands from a PDF version of this guide, double-check that no spaces are missing around line breaks, as sometimes PDF formatting removes them.

</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Typing `help` opens a small window that gives you a quick overview of basic commands you can try out. It‚Äôs a great way to get started without needing to remember everything right away.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

##### **Need more info?**

The Help window also has a **‚ÄúView full User Guide‚Äù** button that links back to this page, so you can always come back here anytime you need more detailed instructions.


##### **How to open the Help window:**
* **Type**: help
* **Press F1** on your keyboard
* Or **click the Help button** in the top menu bar

* **-med MEDICINE:** Prescribed medicines (e.g. Panadol, Antibiotics)


<div class="alert alert-primary">
  <strong>üí° Tips:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>List all medicines as one string, separated by commas. (No need to repeat <code>-med</code> for each item.)</li>
    <li>A person can have any number of conditions and details (including 0).</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>You can store up to <strong>30 patients</strong> in SilverCare. Adding beyond this limit will not be allowed.</li>
    <li><strong>Phone numbers must be unique;</strong> trying to add a patient with an existing number will result in an error.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

![add success](images/addSuccessMessage.png)


### Listing all persons : `list`

Use this command to view all the patients currently in your SilverCare records.

**Command Format:** `list`

When you run this command, SilverCare shows a list of all patients:

* Patients with appointment dates are shown first and sorted by the nearest upcoming appointment.
* Patients without appointment dates appear after, in the order they were added, newest at the bottom.

This way, you can **easily focus on who you need to see** soon, while still keeping track of everyone else.


### Editing a person : `edit`

Use this command to update the details of an existing patient.

**Command Format:** 

`edit INDEX [-n NAME] [-p PHONE] [-a ADDRESS] [-g GENDER] [-d APPOINTMENT DATE] [-c CONDITION]‚Ä¶‚Äã [-det DETAIL]‚Ä¶‚Äã [-med MEDICINE]`

* `INDEX` refers to the number shown beside each patient in the list. It must be a **positive number** (e.g. 1, 2, 3...).
* You must include at least **[one field](#field-options)** to update.
* Fields that you don‚Äôt specify will remain unchanged.


<div class="alert alert-primary">
<strong>üí° Tips:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>To remove all conditions or details, simply type <code>-c</code> or <code>-det</code> without anything after it.</li>
    <li>Medicine is entered as a single string, not multiple repeated flags. (e.g. <code>-med Panadol, Omeprazole</code>)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>When editing conditions or details, existing entries will be <strong>fully replaced</strong>. This means the previous conditions/details will be cleared before your new ones are added.</li>
    <li><strong>Phone numbers must be unique.</strong> If you try to edit a patient‚Äôs phone number to one that already exists in the system, the command will fail.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

**Examples:**
* `edit 1 -p 91234567` e.g. changes the phone number of the first patient to 91234567.
* `edit 2 -n Betsy Crower -c ` e.g. changes the name of the second patient and removes all existing conditions.
* `edit 3 -det Follow-up in 2 weeks -det NKA -med Ibuprofen, Cetirizine` e.g. replaces all existing details with two new ones and updates medication info.


### Locating persons by name: `find`

Use the find command to search for patients by name, appointment date, or to view upcoming appointments. This helps you quickly **locate the right records**, especially when your patient list grows.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
  <strong>‚ÑπÔ∏è Highlight Feature:</strong>  
  Matches found in <strong>names</strong> and <strong>appointment dates</strong> will be highlighted in the results for better visibility!
</div>

1. Find by **Name**: 

    `find -n NAME` searches for patients whose **names** include the keyword you type.
   
   **Command Format:** `find -n KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`
   * **Case-insensitive:** john matches John, JOHN, or johnny.
   * **Partial matches allowed:** typing Ann will match Anna, Annabelle, etc.
   * **Search is flexible:** keywords can be in any order.
   * **At least one match required:** results will include any patient whose name matches any of the keywords.
   * Matching name part will be **highlighted** in the results

   **Examples:**
   
    `find -n John`  e.g. returns John Lim.

    `find -n grace tan` e.g. returns Grace Teo and Alice Tan

    ![result for find grace tan](images/findGraceTanResult.png)

2. Find by **Appointment Date**: 

    `find -d APPOINTMENT DATE` searches for patients who have an appointment on a **specific date**.

    **Command Format:** `find -d YYYY-MM-DD [HH:mm]`
    * Date must be in the **correct format**, with `HH:mm` being optional
    * Date must be a **valid date**
    * Results will include all patients with matching appointment dates.
    * Matching dates will be **highlighted** in the results

      **Example:** `find -d 2026-12-21`

3. Find **Upcoming Appointments**: 

    `find upcoming` shows all patients with appointment dates that are after today‚Äôs date.
   
   **Command Format:** `find upcoming`
   * Automatically filters for future appointments.
   * Sorted by the nearest upcoming date first.
   * Does not include highlighting in the results.

   > If there are no upcoming appointments, the system will let you know.



### Deleting a person : `delete`

Use this command to remove a patient‚Äôs contact and medical information from SilverCare.

**Command Format:** 

`delete INDEX`

* `INDEX` refers to the number shown beside the patient in the list.
* It must be a **positive whole number** (e.g. 1, 2, 3...).

Before the deletion happens, SilverCare will show the patient‚Äôs details and ask you to confirm:

`Are you sure you want to delete the contact with the following details? (y/n)`
* Type `y` to **confirm deletion**
* Type `n` to **cancel**

![delete confirmation message](images/deleteConfirmation.png)

<div class="alert alert-primary">
  <strong>üí° Tips:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>If you enter an <strong>invalid index</strong> (like 0, -1, or something that doesn‚Äôt exist), the system will prompt you to try again.</li>
    <li>If you cancel the deletion (press <code>n</code>), the patient‚Äôs data will stay safe.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

**Examples:**
* Deleting through main list
  1. `list` returns list of patients.
  2. `delete 2` prompts a confirmation to delete patient with the 2nd index.
  3. `y` will result in the 2nd patient deleted from the full list.
* Deleting through filtered search
  1. `find -n` Betsy returns list of patients names containing Betsy.
  2. `delete 1` prompts a confirmation to delete patient with the 1st index.
  3. `y` will result in the 1st patient deleted from the filtered search results.


<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>If you enter an unrecognized input like <code>hello</code> or <code>dslkfjdslf</code> instead of <code>y</code> or <code>n</code>, the app will keep prompting until a clear answer is given.</li>
    <li>If you run a valid command (like <code>list</code>, <code>help</code>, etc.) during the prompt, the deletion will automatically be cancelled.</li>
    <li>Even if you type an invalid or incomplete command (like <code>add</code>), the app still treats it as a command and cancels the deletion.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

This command removes all patient records from SilverCare.

**Command Format:** `clear`

Before clearing, the app will ask you to confirm by typing 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no), so you won‚Äôt accidentally lose your data.

![clear confirmation message](images/clearConfirmation.png)

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Closes the SilverCare app.

**Command Format:** `exit`

You can also close the app using the Exit button in the top menu.


### Saving the data

There‚Äôs **no need to manually save** anything, SilverCare automatically saves your data after every change (like adding or editing a patient).

### Editing the data file (Optional)

If you're an advanced user, you can find and edit SilverCare's data directly:

**Location:** `[JAR file folder]/data/addressbook.json`

The data is stored in JSON format, which you can open with any text editor.



<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Be sure to follow the correct JSON structure when editing this file.</li>
    <li>A small mistake (like a missing comma or quotation mark) can cause the app to stop working properly.</li>
    <li>If you're unsure, it's best to make changes through the app itself using commands.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


### Switch Themes: Toggle Theme
SilverCare supports both **light** and **dark** modes.

You can switch between them anytime:
* Click the **Toggle Theme button** under the View menu in the top-left corner.

## FAQ

**Q**: The app doesn‚Äôt open when I run it. What should I check?

**A**: Here are some common issues to troubleshoot:
* Java not installed or wrong version 

  Make sure Java 17 or above is installed.
  
  You can check this by running: `java -version`
* File name or location changed 

  Make sure the file is still named silvercare.jar and hasn't been renamed by accident.
* Not in the right folder

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate (cd) to the folder where silvercare.jar is located before running:
   `java -jar silvercare.jar`



**Q**: What happens if I type the command wrongly?

**A**: Don‚Äôt worry, SilverCare has built-in error handling. If you make a mistake in your command format (like missing a field or typing something incorrectly), the app will:
* Show an error message
* Give you an example of the correct format so you can try again

    Example: If you type `add -n John`, SilverCare will tell you that required fields are missing and show you the correct format.


**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: When you first run SilverCare on a new computer, it automatically creates a data file in a folder named data, located in the same folder as the app (silvercare.jar).
    
- To transfer your data:
    1. Install Java and place silvercare.jar on the new computer.
    2. Run the app once, this will create the default data file (data/addressbook.json).
    3. Close the app.
    4. On your old computer, go to the folder where you last used SilverCare. Inside the data folder, find the file named:

       `addressbook.json`
    5. Copy this file to a USB drive or cloud storage.
    6. On your new computer, replace the newly created addressbook.json file in the data folder with the one from your old computer.
    7. Reopen SilverCare and your old data should now be visible.

    > If your .jar file is in Documents/SilverCare, your data file will be at:
    Documents/SilverCare/data/addressbook.json

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous SilverCare home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Appointments can be scheduled in the past.** The system does not prevent adding past dates for appointments. Please double-check appointment dates when entering them to avoid confusion.
4. **No warning is shown for overlapping appointments.** The system allows multiple appointments at the same time without any alerts. You may need to check manually to prevent double-bookings.
5. **Recurring appointments must be entered individually.** The system does not yet support repeating weekly or monthly appointments. Each date must be added separately.
6. **Medicine field does not include dosage or frequency.** Only the name of the medicine can be recorded. If needed, dosage and timing details can be added in the notes section manually.
7. **All medical conditions and notes must be retyped when editing.** You cannot edit a single condition or note‚Äîediting one requires re-entering all related information.
8. **Appointments are not visually marked by urgency.** There is no color-coding to indicate how urgent an appointment is. All appointments appear the same in the interface.
9. **Patient list is always sorted by appointment date.** Sorting by name, medication, or other preferences is not currently available.
10. **The command input field is difficult to edit for long entries.** For patients with many details, it can be hard to scroll back and edit earlier parts (like name or address). A suggested workaround is to prepare the command in a text editor before pasting it in.
